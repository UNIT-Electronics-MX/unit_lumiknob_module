# Module Potentiometer Interface with SPI-Controlled MAX7219 LED Driver

This document describes the functionality and application of the Module Potentiometer Interface designed for SPI-controlled sequential LED activation using the MAX7219. The module enables the sequential control of 32 LEDs via a potentiometer, which modulates the illumination speed.

## Overview

The module employs the SPI protocol for communication with the MAX7219 LED driver. A potentiometer is used to adjust the speed at which the LED sequence is activated. Appropriate connections should be made between the potentiometer, MAX7219, and the respective microcontroller pins.

## Hardware Interface

- Potentiometer: Connect to an analog input of the microcontroller.
- MAX7219: Connect to the designated SPI pins (MOSI, SCK, and Chip Select) of the microcontroller.

Ensure that the project directory includes the necessary files, such as `max7219.py` and `main.py`.

## Tested Hardware

The table below enumerates the microcontroller boards that have been verified with this module:

| Board             | Status              |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Arduino Uno       | Not Tested          |
| Raspberry Pi Pico | Not Tested          |
| ESP32C3 SuperMini | Tested and Functional |
| Pulsar C6         | Tested and Functional |

## Example Code

Below is an example demonstrating the use of the module with an ESP32C3 SuperMini board:

```python
import max7219
from machine import Pin, SPI, ADC
import time

spi = SPI(1, baudrate=10000000, polarity=1, phase=0, sck=Pin(4), mosi=Pin(6))
cs = Pin(7, Pin.OUT)
display = max7219.Matrix8x8(spi, cs, 1)

display.brightness(10)

pot = ADC(Pin(0))
pot.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB)

display.fill(0)
display.show()

while True:
    pot_value = pot.read()
    num_leds = int((pot_value / 4095) * 32)

    display.fill(0)
    led_count = 0
    for row in range(8):
        for col in range(8):
            if led_count < num_leds:
                display.pixel(col, row, 1)
                led_count += 1
            else:
                break

    display.show()
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

The sample code retrieves the value from the potentiometer and calculates the corresponding number of LEDs that need to be lit. The LED activation is performed in a sequential manner, progressing row by row from left to right.

## Performance Outcome

The provided GIF demonstrates that the module functions as expected. The potentiometer effectively regulates the sequential activation rate of 32 LEDs, ensuring smooth operation across the display.
