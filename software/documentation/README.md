# Lumiknob module

![product](../../hardware/resources/lumiknob.png)

## Introduction

Lumiknob is a compact, plug-and-play module that combines an analog potentiometer with a digital LED driver to create a dynamic user interface element. It is designed to convert the rotation of a knob into a real-time visual representation using up to 32 LEDs, powered by the MAX7219 chip.

This module simplifies the task of translating analog input into meaningful visual feedback. Whether you are designing an interactive dashboard, building a learning tool, or prototyping control systems, Lumiknob offers a seamless way to visualize position, intensity, or progress through LED sequences or patterns.

Its design emphasizes simplicity and reliability—requiring just a few standard SPI connections to your microcontroller. The analog signal is read, processed, and instantly reflected on the LED array. Because the module offloads LED control to the MAX7219, developers can focus on the behavior logic without dealing with low-level timing or multiplexing.


## Functional Description

- Lumiknob integrates a potentiometer with a MAX7219 LED driver to provide real-time LED control.
- The analog signal is read by a microcontroller and mapped to a digital output pattern for the LEDs.
- Communication with the MAX7219 is handled over SPI, requiring minimal wiring and resources.
- The module is optimized for simplicity and quick integration with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other microcontrollers.
